## Prerequisites

- A development environment, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Node.JS 16+](https://nodejs.org/)

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies, start a development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This development server can run while you are editing the project; any browser tabs will hot reload with your changes.

## Creating a Pull Request

Once you have completed your changes, you can [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to ask for your changes to be merged into this repository.
