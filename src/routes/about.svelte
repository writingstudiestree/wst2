        <h2>About the site</h2>
        <p>The WST is an online, crowdsourced database of academic genealogies within writing studies; in other words, it is an interactive archive for recording and mapping scholarly relationships in Composition and Rhetoric and adjacent disciplines.</p>
        <p>To add or edit content, you must be logged in; use the account icon in the top right corner to request an account or enter your username and password. Once that's done, you can use the menu on the top of your screen to explore the network of people and institutions, create new nodes within that network, or edit existing entries.</p>

        <h2>How did this project start?</h2>
        <p>The first seed for The Writing Studies Tree was planted in Sondra Perl's doctoral seminar in the spring of 2011. It grew into a classroom project and soon extended beyond the classroom, developing roots that were tended to by a team of students and faculty at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (CUNY): Ben Miller (project leader and site administrator), Amanda Licastro (project administrator), Sondra Perl (faculty advisor), Jill Belli, Diana Epelbaum, Chris Leary, Erica Kaufman, Andrew Statum, Lisa Vaia, and Dominique Zino. The initial tree and network visualizations were written by Matt Miller, a graduate student at Pratt Institute.</p>
        <p>But having planted the seeds, we want your help to make the Tree grow! Our chief design goal has been to make it easy to pool our collective knowledge and time. If you would like to contribute, you are welcome to do so!</p>
        <p>We officially launched the site at the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC) as a Featured Session in March of 2012, and were gratified by the positive response. Drawing from the interest garnered by that presentation, three members of the original team - Ben Miller, Amanda Licastro, and Jill Belli (bios are available here) continued developing the site and began the quest to find funding.</p>
        <p>With the help of two Digital Innovation Grants from the Provost's Office of the CUNY Graduate Center (2012-13 and 2013-14), we have been able to unveil several new features this year - including several new interactive data visualizations and two new tagging features - and we plan to create even more features in the next weeks and months. Our work was again granted an interactive booth at CCCC in Las Vegas, and updates on the site's new features and data were shared at session G.03, "Disciplinary Data on Display: Visualizing Keywords in CompPile, Dissertations, and the Writing Studies Tree."</p>
