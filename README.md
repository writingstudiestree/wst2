# wst2

The [Writing Studies Tree](http://writingstudiestree.org) is an open-access, crowdsourced database of academic genealogy in Rhetoric / Composition / Writing Studies that aims to understand the networks of people and places that animate writing studies as a discipline.

**This repository is a public space in which to re-build the WST – better, faster, stronger, together.** We would actively welcome anyone interested in working on a transition from Drupal 7 to something more lightweight and stable.

See [issues](https://github.com/writingstudiestree/wst2/issues) to post or take on problems in need of solutions. We look forward to working with you!
