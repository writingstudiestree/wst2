# Writing Studies Tree

The [Writing Studies Tree](http://writingstudiestree.org/) is an open-access, crowdsourced database of academic genealogy in Rhetoric / Composition / Writing Studies and adjacent fields that aims to understand the networks of people and places that animate writing studies as a discipline.

**This repository is a public space in which to re-build the WST â€“ better, faster, stronger, together.** We would actively welcome anyone interested in working on a transition from Drupal 7 to something more lightweight and stable.

The larger aims of this project are described [in this webtext](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.2/topoi/miller-et-al/index.html) which outlines the intended schema and functionality.
